** Overview This is an *ESPHome external component* that schedules and controls
*EV charging relays* in a *round-robin* fashion. It switches *two active
relays* among four jobs *every 5 minutes*.

** Features
- Round-robin scheduling of *EV chargers or loads*
-  Controls *multiple GPIOs*
-  Integrates seamlessly with *Home Assistant*
-  Configurable via ESPHome *YAML*

** Installation
*** Add External Component to ESPHome
Modify your *ESPHome YAML* to include the component from this repository:

#+begin_src yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/PaulSchulz/ev-charging-scheduler-esphome
      ref: main
#+end_src

*** Configure GPIO Relays
Define *four GPIO switches* for relay control:

#+begin_src yaml
switch:
  - platform: gpio
    pin: 18
    id: relay_1
  - platform: gpio
    pin: 19
    id: relay_2
  - platform: gpio
    pin: 21
    id: relay_3
  - platform: gpio
    pin: 22
    id: relay_4
#+end_src

*** Enable the Scheduler
Add the *scheduler component* and specify the relays it controls:

#+begin_src yaml
ev_scheduler:
  id: my_scheduler
  switches:
    - id: relay_1
    - id: relay_2
    - id: relay_3
    - id: relay_4
#+end_src

** How It Works
- At *startup*, the scheduler initializes and starts *switching jobs*.
- Every *5 minutes*, it *turns off all relays* and *activates the next two* in sequence.
- The *cycle repeats indefinitely* unless overridden manually in Home Assistant.

** Customization
Modify the *switching interval* in `ev_scheduler.cpp`:
#+begin_src cpp
const unsigned long SWITCH_INTERVAL = 300000;  // Default: 5 minutes
#+end_src

** Logs & Debugging
Enable logging to see scheduler status:

#+begin_src yaml
logger:
  level: DEBUG
#+end_src

** Home Assistant Integration
- Manually override *relays* in Home Assistant using `switch.toggle`.
- Automate scheduling based on *solar availability* or *grid pricing*.

** Future Improvements
- [ ] Make the switch interval *configurable in YAML*
- [ ] Add *Home Assistant services* for manual control
- [ ] Support *more than 4 relays*

* EV Charging Scheduler for ESPHome

*Work In Progress*

(Use at you own risk and discretion. None of the code here should be considered

The follow README has been produced with the assistance of ChatGPT (March 2025)

** Overview This is an *ESPHome external component* that schedules and controls
*EV charging relays* in a *round-robin* fashion. It switches *two active
relays* among four jobs *every 5 minutes*.

** Features
- Round-robin scheduling of *EV chargers or loads*
-  Controls *multiple GPIOs*
-  Integrates seamlessly with *Home Assistant*
-  Configurable via ESPHome *YAML*

** Installation
*** Add External Component to ESPHome
Modify your *ESPHome YAML* to include the component from this repository:

#+begin_src yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/PaulSchulz/ev-charging-scheduler-esphome
      ref: master
#+end_src

*** Configure GPIO Relays
Define *four GPIO switches* for relay control:

#+begin_src yaml
switch:
  - platform: gpio
    pin: 18
    id: relay_1
  - platform: gpio
    pin: 19
    id: relay_2
  - platform: gpio
    pin: 21
    id: relay_3
  - platform: gpio
    pin: 22
    id: relay_4
#+end_src

*** Enable the Scheduler
Add the *ev_scheduler component* and specify the relays it controls:

#+begin_src yaml
  ev_scheduler:
    active: operating_switch
    schedule_interval: 20sec
    switches:
      - relay_1
      - relay_2
      - relay_3
      - relay_4
#+end_src

** How It Works
- At *startup*, the scheduler initializes and starts *switching jobs*.
- Every *schedule_interval* (defaults to 5 minutes), it *turns off all relays* and
  *activates the next two* in sequence.
- The *cycle repeats indefinitely* unless overridden manually.

** Customization
Please let me know if there is any behavior that you think should be added.

** Logs & Debugging
Enable logging to see scheduler status:

#+begin_src yaml
logger:
  level: DEBUG
#+end_src

** Home Assistant Integration
With the *Home Assistant* API active, an ESP device programmed with ESPHome will
be automatically detected in Home Assistant, where it can be controlled and
managed.

** Future Improvements
- [X] Make the switch interval *configurable in YAML* (See schedule_interval)
- [ ] Add *Home Assistant services* for manual control
- [ ] Support *more than 4 relays*
